FFmpeg included with ProxyCraft
===============================

$version

These are unmodified FFmpeg and FFprobe binaries from BtbN FFmpeg-Builds,
release $BuildTag, file $BuildZip
(SHA-256 $BuildSha256).

Licence: GNU General Public License version 3 (see LICENSE.txt in this folder).
FFmpeg is a separate program; ProxyCraft runs it and is itself MIT-licensed.

Source code for these binaries:
- FFmpeg, commit ${FFmpegCommit}:
  https://github.com/FFmpeg/FFmpeg/tree/$FFmpegCommit
- Build scripts, which pin the version of every library this build contains:
  https://github.com/BtbN/FFmpeg-Builds/tree/$ScriptsCommit
- Both are also attached to every ProxyCraft release on GitHub as
  $ffmpegSource and $scriptsSource.

To use a different FFmpeg, replace the files in this folder, or select another
ffmpeg.exe in ProxyCraft under Tools > Settings.
